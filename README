------------------------------------------------
  Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming
  2nd Edition
  By Simon Thomson
------------------------------------------------

  My progress through the exercises. My code is mostly contained within the Chapter[n]Exercises.lhs files.

  It's a good book. I'd recommend it for people who are new to Haskell and/or not particularly comfortable in this terrain. I think some Lisp experience will help as the book takes a slightly more abstract approach that *may* give true newcomers to FP some strange ideas. Some understanding of everyday mathemathics is a must.
